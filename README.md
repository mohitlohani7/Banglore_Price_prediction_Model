Got it! Here's a **clean, concise summary** of the **important things you've done in the Jupyter Notebook**, highlighting just the key steps and contributions â€” ideal for showcasing your work quickly:

# âœ… Key Contributions from the Jupyter Notebook

### ðŸ“Œ 1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Converted categorical variables (like location, area type) into numerical using **Label Encoding**.
- Created new meaningful features such as price per square foot.

---

### ðŸ“Š 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized distributions of home prices.
- Analyzed relationships between features using **scatter plots**, **box plots**, and **correlation heatmaps**.
- Identified outliers and anomalies in pricing.

---

### ðŸ§  3. **Model Testing & Selection**
- Built and tested multiple regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - âœ… **XGBoost Regressor** (Best accuracy: **91.3%**)

- Used **GridSearchCV** with **ShuffleSplit** cross-validation to find best hyperparameters.

---

### ðŸ’¾ 4. **Model Saving**
- Saved the final XGBoost model using `pickle`.
- Exported important categorical column data (like `location`, `area_type`, `availability`) using `json`.

---

### ðŸ“‚ 5. **Project Ready for Deployment**
- Model and metadata files (`.pickle` and `.json`) created.
- Environment reproducibility ensured using `environment.yml`.
